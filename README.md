# Instagram_Shiny_App
This project is used to showcase how html templates can make an R shiny app look professional and nice. This app in particular is written in R and is looking at data from my instagram account through connecting into the instagram api.

The shiny app can be viewed at this url: https://samparrott.shinyapps.io/instShinyApp/
